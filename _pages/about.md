## Background
My background is in experimental molecular biology, particularly the scaffolding of signal transduction processes. Since leaving the lab to pursue a Bioinformatics career, I have gained an MRes degree in the subject, and spent 15 years in the Bioinformatics Support Unit providing practical support to a wide array of researchers. I led the BSU for 9 years (2011-2020), before being appointed as Senior Lecturer in Bioinformatics in the School of Biomedical, Nutritional and Sports Sciences.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Senior Lecturer in Bioinformatics in the School of Biomedical, Nutritional and Sport Sciences.

Director of Research, School of Biomedical, Nutritional and Sport Sciences.

## Qualifications
* B.Sc. (Hons) - Biochemistry and Genetics - University of Nottingham, 1999
* Ph.D. - Genetics - University of Leicester, 2004
* M.Res. - Bioinformatics and Computational Biology - University of Leeds, 2005

## Research Interests
I have been a professional bioinformatician for more than 15 years, during which time I have contributed to a large number of collaborative projects as a researcher and an investigator. My recent research career has seen me involved as a co-investigator on a number of large multi-omics investigations of complex disease. Many of these projects have used bulk RNA-Seq to characterise pathological states or to stratify disease, and increasingly these studies are looking to use single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to refine the detail of these systems even further.

My research revolves around a small number of central themes, all involving the analysis of biological data:

* Integration of disparate biological data
* Molecular characterisation of complex disease
* High-throughput sequencing analysis, particulatly functional genomics techniques such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq etc

In recent years, I have been involved in a number of large projects connected to one or more of these themes, including the following:

* Psoriasis Stratification to Optimise Relevant Therapy (PSORT) - MRC, co-Investigator
* Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis (LITMUS) - EU (IMI), co-Investigator
* Elucidating Pathways of Steatohepatitis (EPoS) - EU (H2020), co-Investigator
* An _in silico_ based approach to improve the efficacy and precision of drug REPurpOsing TRIALs for a mechanism-based patient cohort with predominant cerebro-cardiovascular phenotypes (REPO-TRIAL) - EU (H2020), co-Investigator
* Strategic Training Awards for Research Skills - Newcastle University Bioinformatics Skills Schools (NUBASS) - BBSRC, Principal Investigator
