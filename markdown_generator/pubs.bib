	abstract = {Probabilistic functional integrated networks (PFINs) are designed to aid our understanding of cellular biology and can be used to generate testable hypotheses about protein function. PFINs are generally created by scoring the quality of interaction datasets against a Gold Standard dataset, usually chosen from a separate high-quality data source, prior to their integration. Use of an external Gold Standard has several drawbacks, including data redundancy, data loss and the need for identifier mapping, which can complicate the network build and impact on PFIN performance. Additionally, there typically are no Gold Standard data for non-model organisms.},

	abstract = {We read with interest the study by Kayisoglu et al 1 comparing the gene expression between embryo-derived and adult-derived intestinal organoids. Some innate immune system genes were differentially expressed between the two organoid types, suggesting a potential role of exposure to the environment, including gut microbiota, in shaping the intestinal gene expression. In extremely preterm infants ({\textless}32 weeks gestation), microbial–host interaction at the epithelial surface has been associated with various morbidities including late onset sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis.2 Thus, preterm intestinal organoids may provide a specific and robust model for this population.

We expand on the work carried by Kayisoglu et al 1 by comparing whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-sequencing) analysis performed on four preterm (23–32 weeks gestation) and five adult (30–60 years of age)3 intestinal organoid lines exposed to Enterococcus faecalis , a prevalent gut pathobiont.4 Human intestinal organoid lines were generated from preterm (surgical resection) and adult (biopsy) following the protocol described by Stewart et al .5 All specimens were from the ileum. Intestinal organoids were exposed to Enterococcus faecalis in form of monolayer using the organoid-anaerobe co-culture (OACC) model.6 All data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), Accession: GSE161953.
