	abstract = {Macrophages are key target cells of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, implicated as a viral reservoir seeding sanctuary sites such as the central nervous system and testes. This rests on the apparent ability of macrophages to sustain ZIKV replication without experiencing cytopathic effects. ZIKV infection of macrophages triggers an innate immune response involving type I interferons (IFN-I), key antiviral cytokines that play a complex role in ZIKV pathogenesis in animal models. To investigate the functional role of the IFN-I response we generated human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages from a patient with complete deficiency of IFNAR2, the high affinity IFN-I receptor subunit. Accompanying the profound defect of IFN-I signalling in IFNAR2 deficient iPS-macrophages we observed significantly enhanced ZIKV replication and cell death, revealing the inherent cytopathicity of ZIKV towards macrophages. These observations were recapitulated by genetic and pharmacological ablation of IFN-I signalling in control iPS-macrophages and extended to a model of iPS-microglia. Thus, the capacity of macrophages to support noncytolytic ZIKV replication depends on an equilibrium set by IFN-I, suggesting that innate antiviral responses might counterintuitively promote ZIKV persistence via the maintenance of tissue viral reservoirs relevant to pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly prevalent disease that is associated with multiple metabolic disturbances, yet the metabolic pathways underlying its progression are poorly understood. Here, we studied metabolic pathways of the human liver across the full histological spectrum of NAFLD. We analyzed whole liver tissue transcriptomics and serum metabolomics data obtained from a large, prospectively enrolled cohort of 206 histologically characterized patients derived from the European NAFLD Registry and developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of human hepatocytes at different stages of NAFLD. We identified several metabolic signatures in the liver and blood of these patients, specifically highlighting the alteration of vitamins (A, E) and glycosphingolipids, and their link with complex glycosaminoglycans in advanced fibrosis. Furthermore, we derived GEMs and identified metabolic signatures of three common NAFLD-associated gene variants (PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and HSD17B13). The study demonstrates dysregulated liver metabolic pathways which may contribute to the progression of NAFLD.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-022-04834-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Probabilistic functional integrated networks (PFINs) are designed to aid our understanding of cellular biology and can be used to generate testable hypotheses about protein function. PFINs are generally created by scoring the quality of interaction datasets against a Gold Standard dataset, usually chosen from a separate high-quality data source, prior to their integration. Use of an external Gold Standard has several drawbacks, including data redundancy, data loss and the need for identifier mapping, which can complicate the network build and impact on PFIN performance. Additionally, there typically are no Gold Standard data for non-model organisms.
RESULTS: We describe the development of an integration technique, ssNet, that scores and integrates both high-throughput and low-throughout data from a single source database in a consistent manner without the need for an external Gold Standard dataset. Using data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae we show that ssNet is easier and faster, overcoming the challenges of data redundancy, Gold Standard bias and ID mapping. In addition ssNet results in less loss of data and produces a more complete network.
CONCLUSIONS: The ssNet method allows PFINs to be built successfully from a single database, while producing comparable network performance to networks scored using an external Gold Standard source and with reduced data loss.},

	abstract = {Mechanical loading exerts a profound influence on bone density and architecture, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Our study shows that expression of the neurological transcriptional factor zinc finger of the cerebellum 1 (ZIC1) is markedly increased in trabecular bone biopsies in the lumbar spine compared with the iliac crest, skeletal sites of high and low mechanical stress, respectively. Human trabecular bone transcriptome analyses revealed a strong association between ZIC1 mRNA levels and gene transcripts characteristically associated with osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. This supposition is supported by higher ZIC1 expression in iliac bone biopsies from postmenopausal women with osteoporosis compared with age-matched control subjects, as well as strongly significant inverse correlation between ZIC1 mRNA levels and BMI-adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) (Z-score). ZIC1 promoter methylation was decreased in mechanically loaded vertebral bone compared to unloaded normal iliac bone, and its mRNA levels correlated inversely with ZIC1 promoter methylation, thus linking mechanical stress to epigenetic control of gene expression. The findings were corroborated in cultures of rat osteoblast progenitors and osteoblast-like cells. This study demonstrates for the first time how skeletal epigenetic changes that are affected by mechanical forces give rise to marked alteration in bone cell transcriptional activity and translate to human bone pathophysiology.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study.
SETTING: University research center.
PARTICIPANTS: People with MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB, n=55), MCI-AD (n=19), DLB (n=38), AD (n=24) and a cognitively unimpaired comparison group (n=28).
MEASUREMENTS: Ribonucleic acid sequencing of whole blood. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and gene set enrichment analysis was carried out.
RESULTS: Compared with the cognitively unimpaired group, there were 22 DEGs in MCI-LB/DLB and 61 DEGs in MCI-AD/AD. DEGS were also identified when comparing the two disease groups. Expression of ANP32A was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in MCI-AD/AD. Gene set enrichment analysis identified downregulation in gene sets including MYC targets and oxidative phosphorylation in MCI-LB/DLB; upregulation of immune and inflammatory responses in MCI-AD/AD; and upregulation of interferon-α and -γ responses in MCI-AD/AD compared with MCI-LB/DLB.
CONCLUSION: This study identified multiple DEGs in MCI-LB/DLB and MCI-AD/AD. One of these DEGs, ANP32A, may be a prognostic marker in AD. Genes related to mitochondrial function were downregulated in MCI-LB/DLB. Previously reported upregulation of genes associated with inflammation and immune responses in MCI-AD/AD was confirmed in this cohort. Differences in interferon responses between MCI-AD/AD and MCI-LB/DLB suggest that there are key differences in peripheral immune responses between these diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Serum microRNA (miRNA) levels are known to change in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and may serve as useful biomarkers. This study aimed to profile miRNAs comprehensively at all NAFLD stages.
METHODS: We profiled 2,083 serum miRNAs in a discovery cohort (183 cases with NAFLD representing the complete NAFLD spectrum and 10 population controls). miRNA libraries generated by HTG EdgeSeq were sequenced by Illumina NextSeq. Selected serum miRNAs were profiled in 372 additional cases with NAFLD and 15 population controls by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR.
RESULTS: Levels of 275 miRNAs differed between cases and population controls. Fewer differences were seen within individual NAFLD stages, but miR-193a-5p consistently showed increased levels in all comparisons. Relative to NAFL/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with mild fibrosis (stage 0/1), 3 miRNAs (miR-193a-5p, miR-378d, and miR378d) were increased in cases with NASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stages 2-4), 7 (miR193a-5p, miR-378d, miR-378e, miR-320b, miR-320c, miR-320d, and miR-320e) increased in cases with NAFLD activity score (NAS) 5-8 compared with lower NAS, and 3 (miR-193a-5p, miR-378d, and miR-378e) increased but 1 (miR-19b-3p) decreased in steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) activity score 2-4 compared with lower SAF activity. The significant findings for miR-193a-5p were replicated in the additional cohort with NAFLD. Studies in Hep G2 cells showed that following palmitic acid treatment, miR-193a-5p expression decreased significantly. Gene targets for miR-193a-5p were investigated in liver RNAseq data for a case subgroup (n = 80); liver GPX8 levels correlated positively with serum miR-193a-5p.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-193a-5p levels correlate strongly with NAFLD activity grade and fibrosis stage. MiR-193a-5p may have a role in the hepatic response to oxidative stress and is a potential clinically tractable circulating biomarker for progressive NAFLD.
LAY SUMMARY: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small pieces of nucleic acid that may turn expression of genes on or off. These molecules can be detected in the blood circulation, and their levels in blood may change in liver disease including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To see if we could detect specific miRNA associated with advanced stages of NAFLD, we carried out miRNA sequencing in a group of 183 patients with NAFLD of varying severity together with 10 population controls. We found that a number of miRNAs showed changes, mainly increases, in serum levels but that 1 particular miRNA miR-193a-5p consistently increased. We confirmed this increase in a second group of cases with NAFLD. Measuring this miRNA in a blood sample may be a useful way to determine whether a patient has advanced NAFLD without an invasive liver biopsy.},

We hypothesize that de novo mutations play an important role in severe male infertility and explain a portion of the genetic causes of this understudied disorder. To test this hypothesis, we utilize trio-based exome sequencing in a cohort of 185 infertile males and their unaffected parents. Following a systematic analysis, 29 of 145 rare (MAF {\textless} 0.1\%) protein-altering de novo mutations are classified as possibly causative of the male infertility phenotype. We observed a significant enrichment of loss-of-function de novo mutations in loss-of-function-intolerant genes (p-value = 1.00 × 10-5) in infertile men compared to controls. Additionally, we detected a significant increase in predicted pathogenic de novo missense mutations affecting missense-intolerant genes (p-value = 5.01 × 10-4) in contrast to predicted benign de novo mutations. One gene we identify, RBM5, is an essential regulator of male germ cell pre-mRNA splicing and has been previously implicated in male infertility in mice. In a follow-up study, 6 rare pathogenic missense mutations affecting this gene are observed in a cohort of 2,506 infertile patients, whilst we find no such mutations in a cohort of 5,784 fertile men (p-value = 0.03).

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Global RNA sequencing of liver tissue from 98 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD was performed. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering well distinguished NASH from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), and patients with NASH exhibited molecular abnormalities reflecting their pathological features. Transcriptomic analysis identified proteins up-regulated in NASH and/or advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4), including matricellular glycoprotein thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2), encoded by the thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) gene. The intrahepatic THBS2 expression level showed the highest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of 0.915 and 0.957 for diagnosing NASH and advanced fibrosis, respectively. THBS2 positively correlated with inflammation and ballooning according to NAFLD activity score, serum aspartate aminotransferase and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels, and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). THBS2 was associated with extracellular matrix and collagen biosynthesis, platelet activation, caspase-mediated cleavage of cytoskeletal proteins, and immune cell infiltration. Serum TSP-2 expression was measured in 213 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, was significantly higher in NASH than in NAFL, and increased parallel to fibrosis stage. The AUROCs for predicting NASH and advanced fibrosis were 0.776 and 0.856, respectively, which were comparable to Fibrosis-4 index, serum HA level, and NFS in advanced fibrosis diagnosis. Serum TSP-2 level and platelet count were independent predictors of NASH and advanced fibrosis. Serum TSP-2 levels could stratify patients with NAFLD according to the risk of hepatic complications, including liver cancer and decompensated cirrhotic events.
CONCLUSIONS: TSP-2 may be a useful biomarker for NASH and advanced fibrosis diagnosis in patients with NAFLD.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) exerts pleiotropic effects on human skin. DNA damage response and repair pathways are activated by UVB; if damage cannot be repaired, apoptosis ensues. Although cumulative UVB exposure predisposes to skin cancer, UVB phototherapy is widely used as an effective treatment for psoriasis. Previous studies defined the therapeutic action spectrum of UVB and showed that psoriasis is resistant to apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate early molecular responses within psoriasis plaques following irradiation with single equi-erythemogenic doses of clinically-effective (311 nm, narrow-band) compared to clinically-ineffective (290 nm) UVB. Forty-eight micro-dissected epidermal samples from 20 psoriatic patients were analyzed using microarrays. Our bioinformatic analysis compared gene expression between 311 nm irradiated, 290 nm irradiated and control psoriasis epidermis to specifically identify 311 nm UVB differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their upstream regulatory pathways. Key DEGs and pathways were validated by immunohistochemical analysis. There was a dynamic induction and repression of 311 nm UVB DEGs between 6 h and 18 h, only a limited number of DEGs maintained their designated expression status between time-points. Key disease and function pathways included apoptosis, cell death, cell migration and leucocyte chemotaxis. DNA damage response pathways, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and P53 signalling were key nodes, interconnecting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Interferon signalling, dendritic cell maturation, granulocyte adhesion and atherosclerotic pathways were also differentially regulated. Consistent with these findings, top transcriptional regulators of 311 nm UVB DEGs related to: a) apoptosis, DNA damage response and cell cycle control; b) innate/acquired immune regulation and inflammation; c) hypoxia/redox response and angiogenesis; d) circadian rhythmicity; f) EGR/AP1 signalling and keratinocyte differentiation; and g) mitochondrial biogenesis. This research provides important insights into the molecular targets of 311 nm UVB, underscoring key roles for apoptosis and cell death. These and the other key pathways delineated may be central to the therapeutic effects of 311 nm in psoriasis.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can have viral or non-viral causes1-5. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important driver of HCC. Immunotherapy has been approved for treating HCC, but biomarker-based stratification of patients for optimal response to therapy is an unmet need6,7. Here we report the progressive accumulation of exhausted, unconventionally activated CD8+PD1+ T cells in NASH-affected livers. In preclinical models of NASH-induced HCC, therapeutic immunotherapy targeted at programmed death-1 (PD1) expanded activated CD8+PD1+ T cells within tumours but did not lead to tumour regression, which indicates that tumour immune surveillance was impaired. When given prophylactically, anti-PD1 treatment led to an increase in the incidence of NASH-HCC and in the number and size of tumour nodules, which correlated with increased hepatic CD8+PD1+CXCR6+, TOX+, and TNF+ T cells. The increase in HCC triggered by anti-PD1 treatment was prevented by depletion of CD8+ T cells or TNF neutralization, suggesting that CD8+ T cells help to induce NASH-HCC, rather than invigorating or executing immune surveillance. We found similar phenotypic and functional profiles in hepatic CD8+PD1+ T cells from humans with NAFLD or NASH. A meta-analysis of three randomized phase III clinical trials that tested inhibitors of PDL1 (programmed death-ligand 1) or PD1 in more than 1,600 patients with advanced HCC revealed that immune therapy did not improve survival in patients with non-viral HCC. In two additional cohorts, patients with NASH-driven HCC who received anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment showed reduced overall survival compared to patients with other aetiologies. Collectively, these data show that non-viral HCC, and particularly NASH-HCC, might be less responsive to immunotherapy, probably owing to NASH-related aberrant T cell activation causing tissue damage that leads to impaired immune surveillance. Our data provide a rationale for stratification of patients with HCC according to underlying aetiology in studies of immunotherapy as a primary or adjuvant treatment.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms that drive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain incompletely understood. This large multicenter study characterized the transcriptional changes that occur in liver tissue across the NAFLD spectrum as disease progresses to cirrhosis to identify potential circulating markers. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on a discovery cohort comprising histologically characterized NAFLD samples from 206 patients. Unsupervised clustering stratified NAFLD on the basis of disease activity and fibrosis stage with differences in age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), type 2 diabetes mellitus, and carriage of PNPLA3 rs738409, a genetic variant associated with NAFLD. Relative to early disease, we consistently identified 25 differentially expressed genes as fibrosing steatohepatitis progressed through stages F2 to F4. This 25-gene signature was independently validated by logistic modeling in a separate replication cohort (n = 175), and an integrative analysis with publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data elucidated the likely relative contribution of specific intrahepatic cell populations. Translating these findings to the protein level, SomaScan analysis in more than 300 NAFLD serum samples confirmed that circulating concentrations of proteins AKR1B10 and GDF15 were strongly associated with disease activity and fibrosis stage. Supporting the biological plausibility of these data, in vitro functional studies determined that endoplasmic reticulum stress up-regulated expression of AKR1B10, GDF15, and PDGFA, whereas GDF15 supplementation tempered the inflammatory response in macrophages upon lipid loading and lipopolysaccharide stimulation. This study provides insights into the pathophysiology of progressive fibrosing steatohepatitis, and proof of principle that transcriptomic changes represent potentially tractable and clinically relevant markers of disease progression.},

We aimed to detect clusters of differentially regulated genes in the epithelial and fibroblast cells of patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) and healthy controls.
METHODOLOGY: Carefully phenotyped CRSsNP and healthy control participants were recruited. Primary cultures of isolated epithelial and fibroblast cells were established. Whole transcriptome analysis of the cells was performed using microarrays and replicated with quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Fibroblast cells from CRSsNP patients showed a significant upregulation (more than 2x) of the transcription factor NFE2L3 when compared to healthy controls by microarray with multiple hypothesis testing correction, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we have utilized microarray analysis to search for differentially expressed genes in isolated patient derived epithelial and fibroblast cells. The transcription factor NFE2L3 has been shown to be upregulated in fibroblast cells consistent with increasing evidence that fibroblasts play a key role in tissue specific inflammation within the paranasal sinuses.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jhep.2020.04.003},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Genetic factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain incompletely understood. To date, most genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have adopted radiologically assessed hepatic triglyceride content as the reference phenotype and so cannot address steatohepatitis or fibrosis. We describe a GWAS encompassing the full spectrum of histologically characterised NAFLD.
METHODS: The GWAS involved 1,483 European NAFLD cases and 17,781 genetically matched controls. A replication cohort of 559 NAFLD cases and 945 controls was genotyped to confirm signals showing genome-wide or close to genome-wide significance.
RESULTS: Case-control analysis identified signals showing p values ≤5 × 10-8 at 4 locations (chromosome [chr] 2 GCKR/C2ORF16; chr4 HSD17B13; chr19 TM6SF2; chr22 PNPLA3) together with 2 other signals with p {\textless}1 × 10-7 (chr1 near LEPR and chr8 near IDO2/TC1). Case-only analysis of quantitative traits showed that the PNPLA3 signal (rs738409) had genome-wide significance for steatosis, fibrosis and NAFLD activity score and a new signal (PYGO1 rs62021874) had close to genome-wide significance for steatosis (p = 8.2 × 10-8). Subgroup case-control analysis for NASH confirmed the PNPLA3 signal. The chr1 LEPR single nucleotide polymorphism also showed genome-wide significance for this phenotype. Considering the subgroup with advanced fibrosis (≥F3), the signals on chr2, chr19 and chr22 maintained their genome-wide significance. Except for GCKR/C2ORF16, the genome-wide significance signals were replicated.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms PNPLA3 as a risk factor for the full histological spectrum of NAFLD at genome-wide significance levels, with important contributions from TM6SF2 and HSD17B13. PYGO1 is a novel steatosis modifier, suggesting that Wnt signalling pathways may be relevant in NAFLD pathogenesis.
LAY SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a common disease where excessive fat accumulates in the liver and may result in cirrhosis. To understand who is at risk of developing this disease and suffering liver damage, we undertook a genetic study to compare the genetic profiles of people suffering from fatty liver disease with genetic profiles seen in the general population. We found that particular sequences in 4 different areas of the human genome were seen at different frequencies in the fatty liver disease cases. These sequences may help predict an individual's risk of developing advanced disease. Some genes where these sequences are located may also be good targets for future drug treatments.},

In this study, we compare DNA methylation values of shared CpGs of the same human cartilage samples assayed using both platforms. DNA methylation was measured in 21 human cartilage samples using the both 450K and EPIC arrays. Additional matched 450K and EPIC data in whole tumour and whole blood were downloaded from GEO GSE92580 and GSE86833, respectively. Data were processed using the Bioconductor package Minfi. DNA methylation of six CpG sites was validated for the same 21 cartilage samples by pyrosequencing. In cartilage samples, overall sample correlations of methylation values between arrays were high (Pearson's r {\textgreater} 0.96). However, 50.5\% of CpG sites showed poor correlation (r {\textless} 0.2) between arrays. Sites with limited variance and with either very high or very low methylation levels in cartilage exhibited lower correlation values, corroborating prior studies in whole blood. Bisulphite pyrosequencing did not highlight one array as generating more accurate methylation values. For a specific CpG site, the array methylation correlation coefficient differed between cartilage, tumour, and whole blood, reflecting the difference in methylation variance between cell types. Researchers should be cautious when analysing methylation of CpG sites that show low methylation variance within the cell type of interest, regardless of the method used to assay methylation.},

Here we find androgens regulate splicing through AR-mediated transcriptional control of the epithelial-specific splicing regulator ESRP2. Both ESRP2 and its close paralog ESRP1 are highly expressed in primary prostate cancer. Androgen stimulation induces splicing switches in many endogenous ESRP2-controlled mRNA isoforms, including splicing switches correlating with disease progression. ESRP2 expression in clinical prostate cancer is repressed by ADT, which may thus inadvertently dampen epithelial splice programmes. Supporting this, treatment with the AR antagonist bicalutamide (Casodex) induced mesenchymal splicing patterns of genes including FLNB and CTNND1.

Pax9 is expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm and is downregulated in Tbx1 mutant mice. We show here that Pax9-deficient mice are born with complex cardiovascular malformations that affect the outflow tract and aortic arch arteries with failure of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arch arteries to form correctly. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Pax9 and Tbx1 may function together, and mice double heterozygous for Tbx1/Pax9 presented with a significantly increased incidence of interrupted aortic arch when compared with Tbx1 heterozygous mice. Using a novel Pax9Cre allele, we demonstrated that the site of this Tbx1-Pax9 genetic interaction is the pharyngeal endoderm, therefore revealing that a Tbx1-Pax9-controlled signalling mechanism emanating from the pharyngeal endoderm is required for crucial tissue interactions during normal morphogenesis of the pharyngeal arch artery system.},

	abstract = {Male germ cells of all placental mammals express an ancient nuclear RNA binding protein of unknown function called RBMXL2. Here we find that deletion of the retrogene encoding RBMXL2 blocks spermatogenesis. Transcriptome analyses of age-matched deletion mice show that RBMXL2 controls splicing patterns during meiosis. In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a Rbmxl2 retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection.},

	abstract = {Ductular reaction (DR) represents the activation of hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) and has been associated with features of advanced chronic liver disease; yet it is not clear whether these cells contribute to disease progression and how the composition of their micro-environment differs depending on the aetiology. This study aimed to identify HPC-associated signalling pathways relevant in different chronic liver diseases using a high-throughput sequencing approach. DR/HPCs were isolated using laser microdissection from patient samples diagnosed with HCV or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), as models for hepatocellular or biliary regeneration. Key signals were validated at the protein level for a cohort of 56 patients (20 early and 36 advanced stage). In total, 330 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the HPCs in HCV and PSC. Recruitment and homing of inflammatory cells were distinctly different depending on the aetiology. HPCs in PSC were characterised by a response to oxidative stress (e.g. JUN, VNN1) and neutrophil-attractant chemokines (CXCL5, CXCL6, IL-8), whereas HPCs in HCV were identified by T- and B-lymphocyte infiltration. Moreover, we found that communication between HPCs and macrophages was aetiology driven. In PSC, a high frequency of CCL28-positive macrophages was observed in the portal infiltrate, already in early disease in the absence of advanced fibrosis, while in HCV, HPCs showed a strong expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor MARCO. Interestingly, DR/HPCs in PSC showed more deposition of ECM (e.g. FN1, LAMC2, collagens) compared to HCV, where an increase of pro-invasive genes (e.g. PDGFRA, IGF2) was observed. Additionally, endothelial cells in the vicinity of DR/HPCs showed differential immunopositivity (e.g. IGF2 and INHBA expression). In conclusion, our data shine light on the role of DR/HPCs in immune signalling, fibrogenesis and angiogenesis in chronic liver disease.

To this end, retinal organoids generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) at three time points of differentiation. Combinatorial data from all time points revealed the presence of nine clusters, five of which corresponded to key retinal cell types: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cone and rod photoreceptors, and Müller glia. The remaining four clusters expressed genes typical of mitotic cells, extracellular matrix components and those involved in homeostasis. The cell clustering analysis revealed the decreasing presence of mitotic cells and RGCs, formation of a distinct RPE cluster, the emergence of cone and rod photoreceptors from photoreceptor precursors, and an increasing number of Müller glia cells over time. Pseudo-time analysis resembled the order of cell birth during retinal development, with the mitotic cluster commencing the trajectory and the large majority of Müller glia completing the time line. Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility and potential of scRNA-Seq to dissect the inherent complexity of retinal organoids and the orderly birth of key retinal cell types.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cellular response to ionizing radiation involves activation of p53-dependent pathways and activation of the atypical NF-κB pathway. The crosstalk between these two transcriptional networks include (co)regulation of common gene targets. Here we looked for novel genes potentially (co)regulated by p53 and NF-κB using integrative genomics screening in human osteosarcoma U2-OS cells irradiated with a high dose (4 and 10 Gy). Radiation-induced expression in cells with silenced TP53 or RELA (coding the p65 NF-κB subunit) genes was analyzed by RNA-Seq while radiation-enhanced binding of p53 and RelA in putative regulatory regions was analyzed by ChIP-Seq, then selected candidates were validated by qPCR.
RESULTS: We identified a subset of radiation-modulated genes whose expression was affected by silencing of both TP53 and RELA, and a subset of radiation-upregulated genes where radiation stimulated binding of both p53 and RelA. For three genes, namely IL4I1, SERPINE1, and CDKN1A, an antagonistic effect of the TP53 and RELA silencing was consistent with radiation-enhanced binding of both p53 and RelA. This suggested the possibility of a direct antagonistic (co)regulation by both factors: activation by NF-κB and inhibition by p53 of IL4I1, and activation by p53 and inhibition by NF-κB of CDKN1A and SERPINE1. On the other hand, radiation-enhanced binding of both p53 and RelA was observed in a putative regulatory region of the RRAD gene whose expression was downregulated both by TP53 and RELA silencing, which suggested a possibility of direct (co)activation by both factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Four new candidates for genes directly co-regulated by NF-κB and p53 were revealed.},

We aimed to investigate their association with the individual disease activity domains of the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) in a large well-characterized pSS cohort.
METHODS: Sera from pSS patients enrolled in the UK Primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry (UKPSSR) (n = 553) and healthy controls (n = 286) were analysed for FLC (κ and λ), BAFF and β2 M. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for patient clinical characteristics, including salivary flow, Schirmer's test, EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index and serum IgG levels. Poisson regression was performed to identify independent predictors of total ESSDAI and ClinESSDAI (validated ESSDAI minus the biological domain) scores and their domains.
RESULTS: Levels of BAFF, β2M and FLCs were higher in pSS patients compared to controls. All three biomarkers associated significantly with the ESSDAI and the ClinESSDAI. BAFF associated with the peripheral nervous system domain of the ESSDAI, whereas β2M and FLCs associated with the cutaneous, biological and renal domains. Multivariate analysis showed BAFF, β2M and their interaction to be independent predictors of ESSDAI/ClinESSDAI. FLCs were also shown to associate with the ESSDAI/ClinESSDAI but not independent of serum IgG.
CONCLUSION: All biomarkers were associated with total ESSDAI scores but with differing domain associations. These findings should encourage further investigation of these biomarkers in longitudinal studies and against other disease activity measures.},

	abstract = {The NF-κB transcription factors are activated via diverse molecular mechanisms in response to various types of stimuli. A plethora of functions associated with specific sets of target genes could be regulated differentially by this factor, affecting cellular response to stress including an anticancer treatment. Here we aimed to compare subsets of NF-κB-dependent genes induced in cells stimulated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine and in cells damaged by a high dose of ionizing radiation (4 and 10 Gy). The RelA-containing NF-κB species were activated by the canonical TNFα-induced and the atypical radiation-induced pathways in human osteosarcoma cells. NF-κB-dependent genes were identified using the gene expression profiling (by RNA-Seq) in cells with downregulated RELA combined with the global profiling of RelA binding sites (by ChIP-Seq), with subsequent validation of selected candidates by quantitative PCR. There were 37 NF-κB-dependent protein-coding genes identified: in all cases RelA bound in their regulatory regions upon activation while downregulation of RELA suppressed their stimulus-induced upregulation, which apparently indicated the positive regulation mode. This set of genes included a few "novel" NF-κB-dependent species. Moreover, the evidence for possible negative regulation of ATF3 gene by NF-κB was collected. The kinetics of the NF-κB activation was slower in cells exposed to radiation than in cytokine-stimulated ones. However, subsets of NF-κB-dependent genes upregulated by both types of stimuli were essentially the same. Hence, one should expect that similar cellular processes resulting from activation of the NF-κB pathway could be induced in cells responding to pro-inflammatory cytokines and in cells where so-called "sterile inflammation" response was initiated by radiation-induced damage.},

Cross platform comparative analysis of transcriptomic data elucidated the connections between these entities in the context of ageing. Tissue-engineered tendons differentiated from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells from young (20-24 years) and old (54-70 years) donors were assayed using ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq). Extension of the experiment to microarray and RNA-seq data from tendon identified gender specific gene expression changes highlighting disparity with existing literature and published pathways. Separation of RNA-seq data by sex revealed underlying negative binomial distributions which increased statistical power. Sex specific de novo transcriptome assemblies generated fewer larger transcripts that contained miRNAs, lincRNAs and snoRNAs. The results identify that in old males decreased expression of CRABP2 leads to cell proliferation, whereas in old females it leads to cellular senescence. In conjunction with existing literature the results explain gender disparity in the development and types of degenerative diseases as well as highlighting a wide range of considerations for the analysis of transcriptomic data. Wider implications are that degenerative diseases may need to be treated differently in males and females because alternative mechanisms may be involved.},

Traditional methods for the study of these areas, such as tiling arrays, are noisy, labour-intensive and lack the resolution required for densely-packed bacterial genomes. Recently, deep sequencing has become increasingly popular for the study of the transcriptome due to its lower costs, higher accuracy and single nucleotide resolution. These methods have revolutionised our understanding of prokaryotic transcriptional dynamics. Here, we review the deep sequencing and data analysis techniques that are available for the study of transcription in prokaryotes, and discuss the bioinformatic considerations of these analyses.},

	abstract = {The transcription error rate estimated from mistakes in end product RNAs is 10−3–10−5. We analyzed the fidelity of nascent RNAs from all actively transcribing elongation complexes (ECs) in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that 1–3\% of all ECs in wild-type cells, and 5–7\% of all ECs in cells lacking proofreading factors are, in fact, misincorporated complexes. With the exception of a number of sequence-dependent hotspots, most misincorporations are distributed relatively randomly. Misincorporation at hotspots does not appear to be stimulated by pausing. Since misincorporation leads to a strong pause of transcription due to backtracking, our findings indicate that misincorporation could be a major source of transcriptional pausing and lead to conflicts with other RNA polymerases and replication in bacteria and eukaryotes. This observation implies that physical resolution of misincorporated complexes may be the main function of the proofreading factors Gre and TFIIS. Although misincorporation mechanisms between bacteria and eukaryotes appear to be conserved, the results suggest the existence of a bacteria-specific mechanism(s) for reducing misincorporation in protein-coding regions. The links between transcription fidelity, human disease, and phenotypic variability in genetically-identical cells can be explained by the accumulation of misincorporated complexes, rather than mistakes in mature RNA.},

This is associated with reduced blood flow or hypometabolism on imaging of the primary visual cortex. To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using unbiased stereology. Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved interneurone populations indicating possible interneurone dysfunction. This was demonstrated by loss of post synaptic GABA receptor markers including gephyrin, GABARAP, and Kif5A, indicating reduced GABAergic synaptic activity. Glutamatergic neuronal signalling was also altered with vesicular glutamate transporter protein and PSD-95 expression being reduced. Changes to the primary visual cortex in DLB indicate that reduced GABAergic transmission may contribute to RCVH in DLB and treatment using targeted GABAergic modulation or similar approaches using glutamatergic modification may be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Drug development is both increasing in cost whilst decreasing in productivity. There is a general acceptance that the current paradigm of R\&D needs to change. One alternative approach is drug repositioning. With target-based approaches utilised heavily in the field of drug discovery, it becomes increasingly necessary to have a systematic method to rank gene-disease associations. Although methods already exist to collect, integrate and score these associations, they are often not a reliable reflection of expert knowledge. Furthermore, the amount of data available in all areas covered by bioinformatics is increasing dramatically year on year. It thus makes sense to move away from more generalised hypothesis driven approaches to research to one that allows data to generate their own hypothesis. We introduce an integrated, data driven approach to drug repositioning. We first apply a Bayesian statistics approach to rank 309,885 gene-disease associations using existing knowledge. Ranked associations are then integrated with other biological data to produce a semantically-rich drug discovery network. Using this network, we show how our approach identifies diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) to be an area of interest. CNS disorders are identified due to the low numbers of such disorders that currently have marketed treatments, in comparison to other therapeutic areas. We then systematically mine our network for semantic subgraphs that allow us to infer drug-disease relations that are not captured in the network. We identify and rank 275,934 drug-disease has\_indication associations after filtering those that are more likely to be side effects, whilst commenting on the top ranked associations in more detail. The dataset has been created in Neo4j and is available for download at https://bitbucket.org/ncl-intbio/genediseaserepositioning along with a Java implementation of the searching algorithm.},

Our goal was to elucidate whether expression of factors crucial for colorectal homoeostasis is affected by physiologic differences in Se status. Using transcriptomics and proteomics followed by pathway analysis, we identified pathways affected by Se status in rectal biopsies from 22 healthy adults, including 11 controls with optimal status (mean plasma Se = 1.43 μM) and 11 subjects with suboptimal status (mean plasma Se = 0.86 μM). We observed that 254 genes and 26 proteins implicated in cancer (80\%), immune function and inflammatory response (40\%), cell growth and proliferation (70\%), cellular movement, and cell death (50\%) were differentially expressed between the 2 groups. Expression of 69 genes, including selenoproteins W1 and K, which are genes involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and transcription factor NFκB signaling, correlated significantly with Se status. Integrating proteomics and transcriptomics datasets revealed reduced inflammatory and immune responses and cytoskeleton remodelling in the suboptimal Se status group. This is the first study combining omics technologies to describe the impact of differences in Se status on colorectal expression patterns, revealing that suboptimal Se status could alter inflammatory signaling and cytoskeleton in human rectal mucosa and so influence cancer risk.-Méplan, C., Johnson, I.

Among these, phosphorylation of the RelA(p65) Thr505 residue has been described as an important regulator of NF-κB activity in cell lines, but its physiological significance was not known. Therefore, to learn more about the role of this pathway in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse with a RelA T505A mutation. Unlike RelA knockout mice, the RelA T505A mice develop normally but exhibit aberrant hepatocyte proliferation following liver partial hepatectomy or damage resulting from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. Consistent with these effects, RelA T505A mice exhibit earlier onset of cancer in the N-nitrosodiethylamine model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data reveal a critical pathway controlling NF-κB function in the liver that acts to suppress the tumour-promoting activities of RelA.},

	abstract = {Current research and development approaches to drug discovery have become less fruitful and more costly. One alternative paradigm is that of drug repositioning. Many marketed examples of repositioned drugs have been identified through serendipitous or rational observations, highlighting the need for more systematic methodologies to tackle the problem. Systems level approaches have the potential to enable the development of novel methods to understand the action of therapeutic compounds, but requires an integrative approach to biological data. Integrated networks can facilitate systems level analyses by combining multiple sources of evidence to provide a rich description of drugs, their targets and their interactions. Classically, such networks can be mined manually where a skilled person is able to identify portions of the graph (semantic subgraphs) that are indicative of relationships between drugs and highlight possible repositioning opportunities. However, this approach is not scalable. Automated approaches are required to systematically mine integrated networks for these subgraphs and bring them to the attention of the user. We introduce a formal framework for the definition of integrated networks and their associated semantic subgraphs for drug interaction analysis and describe DReSMin, an algorithm for mining semantically-rich networks for occurrences of a given semantic subgraph. This algorithm allows instances of complex semantic subgraphs that contain data about putative drug repositioning opportunities to be identified in a computationally tractable fashion, scaling close to linearly with network data. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by mining an integrated drug interaction network built from 11 sources. This work identified and ranked 9,643,061 putative drug-target interactions, showing a strong correlation between highly scored associations and those supported by literature. We discuss the 20 top ranked associations in more detail, of which 14 are novel and 6 are supported by the literature. We also show that our approach better prioritizes known drug-target interactions, than other state-of-the art approaches for predicting such interactions.},

	abstract = {Only a small number of genes are known direct targets of the zinc-responsive transcription factor MTF1; therefore, the aim of this study was to gain a more complete understanding of the MTF-1 regulated zinc-responsive component of the transcriptome. A targeted siRNA was used to deplete MTF1 expression in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2. We predicted that the response to zinc of direct MTF1 target genes would be abrogated by MTF1 knockdown. Surprisingly, a greater number of genes were regulated by zinc following MFT1 knockdown, and most genes that responded to zinc under both control and MTF1-depleted conditions had an augmented response in the latter condition. Exceptions were the zinc effluxer ZnT1 and a suite of metallothionein genes, suggesting that responses of other genes to zinc are usually buffered by increases in these proteins. We propose that MTF1 heads a hierarchy of zinc sensors, and through controlling the expression of a raft of metallothioneins and other key proteins involved in controlling intracellular zinc levels (e.g. ZnT1) alters zinc buffering capacity and total cellular zinc content. We tested and validated this model by overexpressing metallothionein and observing the predicted curtailment in response of the zinc-repressed SLC30A5 (ZnT5) promoter. The model provides the framework for an integrated understanding of cellular zinc homeostasis. Because MTs can bind metals other than zinc, this framework links with overall cellular metal homeostasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a debilitating condition with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Fatigue is frequently reported by patients suffering from primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS), a chronic autoimmune condition characterised by dryness of the eyes and the mouth. However, although fatigue is common in pSS, it does not manifest in all sufferers, providing an excellent model with which to explore the potential underpinning biological mechanisms.
METHODS: Whole blood samples from 133 fully-phenotyped pSS patients stratified for the presence of fatigue, collected by the UK primary Sjögren's Syndrome Registry, were used for whole genome microarray. The resulting data were analysed both on a gene by gene basis and using pre-defined groups of genes. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as a feature selection technique for input into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Classification was assessed using area under curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic and standard error of Wilcoxon statistic, SE(W).
RESULTS: Although no genes were individually found to be associated with fatigue, 19 metabolic pathways were enriched in the high fatigue patient group using GSEA. Analysis revealed that these enrichments arose from the presence of a subset of 55 genes. A radial kernel SVM classifier with this subset of genes as input displayed significantly improved performance over classifiers using all pathway genes as input. The classifiers had AUCs of 0.866 (SE(W) 0.002) and 0.525 (SE(W) 0.006), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of gene expression data from pSS patients discordant for fatigue identified 55 genes which are predictive of fatigue level using SVM classification. This list represents the first step in understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of fatigue in patients with pSS.},

Here we report the surprising result that c-rel-/- mice display significantly earlier lymphomagenesis in the c-Myc driven, Eμ-Myc model of B-cell lymphoma. c-Rel loss also led to earlier onset of disease in a separate TCL1-Tg-driven lymphoma model. Tumour reimplantation experiments indicated that this is an effect intrinsic to the Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells but, counterintuitively, c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc lymphoma cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. To learn more about why loss of c-Rel led to earlier onset of disease, microarray gene expression analysis was performed on B cells from 4-week-old, wild-type and c-rel-/- Eμ-Myc mice. Extensive changes in gene expression were not seen at this age, but among those transcripts significantly downregulated by the loss of c-Rel was the B-cell tumour suppressor BTB and CNC homology 2 (Bach2). Quantitative PCR and western blot analysis confirmed loss of Bach2 in c-Rel mutant Eμ-Myc tumours at both 4 weeks and the terminal stages of disease. Moreover, Bach2 expression was also downregulated in c-rel-/- TCL1-Tg mice and RelA Thr505Ala mutant Eμ-Myc mice. Analysis of wild-type Eμ-Myc mice demonstrated that the population expressing low levels of Bach2 exhibited the earlier onset of lymphoma seen in c-rel-/- mice. Confirming the relevance of these findings to human disease, analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data revealed that Bach2 is a c-Rel and NF-κB target gene in transformed human B cells, whereas treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma cells with inhibitors of the NF-κB/IκB kinase pathway or deletion of c-Rel or RelA resulted in loss of Bach2 expression. These data reveal a surprising tumour suppressor role for c-Rel in lymphoma development explained by regulation of Bach2 expression, underlining the context-dependent complexity of NF-κB signalling in cancer.},

In the absence of functional TOP2B there are errors in axon guidance in the zebrafish eye. Specific heparin sulphate structures are involved in retinal axon targeting.

DNA polymerase α-primase (Pol α) and DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) replicate the lagging-strand and Pol α and DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) the leading-strand. To identify factors affecting coordination of DNA replication, we have performed genome-wide quantitative fitness analyses of budding yeast cells containing defective polymerases. We combined temperature-sensitive mutations affecting the three replicative polymerases, Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε with genome-wide collections of null and reduced function mutations. We identify large numbers of genetic interactions that inform about the roles that specific genes play to help Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε function. Surprisingly, the overlap between the genetic networks affecting the three DNA polymerases does not represent the majority of the genetic interactions identified. Instead our data support a model for division of labor between the different DNA polymerases during DNA replication. For example, our genetic interaction data are consistent with biochemical data showing that Pol ε is more important to the Pre-Loading complex than either Pol α or Pol δ. We also observed distinct patterns of genetic interactions between leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases, with particular genes being important for coupling proliferating cell nuclear antigen loading/unloading (Ctf18, Elg1) with nucleosome assembly (chromatin assembly factor 1, histone regulatory HIR complex). Overall our data reveal specialized genetic networks that affect different aspects of leading- and lagging-strand DNA replication.

Altered DNA methylation is highly prevalent in ALL and raises the possibility that DNA methylation-based biomarkers could predict patient outcome. In this study, genome-wide methylation analysis, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform, was carried out on 52 diagnostic patient samples from 4 genetic subtypes [ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy (HeH), TCF3-PBX1 and dic(9;20)(p11-13;q11)] in a 1:1 case-control design with patients who went on to relapse (as cases) and patients achieving long-term remission (as controls). Pyrosequencing assays for selected loci were used to confirm the array-generated data. Non-negative matrix factorization consensus clustering readily clustered samples according to genetic subgroups and gene enrichment pathway analysis suggested that this is in part driven by epigenetic disruption of subtype specific signaling pathways. Multiple bioinformatics approaches (including bump hunting and individual locus analysis) were used to identify CpG sites or regions associated with outcome. However, no associations with relapse were identified. Our data revealed that ETV6-RUNX1 and dic(9;20) subtypes were mostly associated with hypermethylation; conversely, TCF3-PBX1 and HeH were associated with hypomethylation. We observed significant enrichment of the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway in TCF3-PBX1 as well as an enrichment of genes involved in immunity and infection pathways in ETV6-RUNX1 subtype.

	doi = {10.1186/s40246-015-0036-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: SIRT1 is likely to play a role in the extension in healthspan induced by dietary restriction. Actions of SIRT1 are pleiotropic, and effects on healthspan may include effects on DNA methylation. Polycomb group protein target genes (PCGTs) are suppressed by epigenetic mechanisms in stem cells, partly through the actions of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), and have been shown previously to correspond with loci particularly susceptible to age-related changes in DNA methylation. We hypothesised that SIRT1 would affect DNA methylation particularly at PCGTs. To map the sites in the genome where SIRT1 affects DNA methylation, we altered SIRT1 expression in human intestinal (Caco-2) and vascular endothelial (HuVEC) cells by transient transfection with an expression construct or with siRNA. DNA was enriched for the methylated fraction then sequenced (HuVEC) or hybridised to a human promoter microarray (Caco-2).
RESULTS: The profile of genes where SIRT1 manipulation affected DNA methylation was enriched for PCGTs in both cell lines, thus supporting our hypothesis. SIRT1 knockdown affected the mRNA for none of seven PRC components nor for DNMT1 or DNMT3b. We thus find no evidence that SIRT1 affects DNA methylation at PCGTs by affecting the expression of these gene transcripts. EZH2, a component of PRC2 that can affect DNA methylation through association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), did not co-immunoprecipitate with SIRT1, and SIRT1 knockdown did not affect the expression of EZH2 protein. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects of SIRT1 on DNA methylation at PCGTs are mediated through direct intermolecular association with EZH2 or through effects in its expression.
CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 affects DNA methylation across the genome, but particularly at PCGTs. Although the mechanism through which SIRT1 has these effects is yet to be uncovered, this action is likely to contribute to extended healthspan, for example under conditions of dietary restriction.},

	abstract = {We previously identified the ZTRE (zinc transcriptional regulatory element) in genes involved in zinc homeostasis and showed that it mediates transcriptional repression in response to zinc. We now report that ZNF658 acts at the ZTRE. ZNF658 was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of a band excised after electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a ZTRE probe. The protein contains a KRAB domain and 21 zinc fingers. It has similarity with ZAP1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which regulates the response to zinc restriction, including a conserved DNA binding region we show to be functional also in ZNF658. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ZNF658 abrogated the zinc-induced, ZTRE-dependent reduction in SLC30A5 (ZnT5 gene), SLC30A10 (ZnT10 gene), and CBWD transcripts in human Caco-2 cells and the ability of zinc to repress reporter gene expression from corresponding promoter-reporter constructs. Microarray analysis of the effect of reducing ZNF658 expression by siRNA uncovered a large decrease in rRNA. We find that ZTREs are clustered within the 45S rRNA precursor. We also saw effects on expression of multiple ribosomal proteins. ZNF658 thus links zinc homeostasis with ribosome biogenesis, the most active transcriptional, and hence zinc-demanding, process in the cell. ZNF658 is thus a novel transcriptional regulator that plays a fundamental role in the orchestrated cellular response to zinc availability.},

Peptide aptamers have been shown to be valuable for use as a component of novel, direct detection methods. These small peptides have a number of advantages over antibodies, including greater specificity and longer shelf life. These properties facilitate their use as the detector components of biosensor devices. However, the identification of suitable aptamer targets for particular groups of organisms is challenging. We present a semi-automated processing pipeline for the identification of candidate aptamer targets from whole bacterial genome sequences. The pipeline can be configured to search for protein sequence fragments that uniquely identify a set of strains of interest. The system is also capable of identifying additional organisms that may be of interest due to their possession of protein fragments in common with the initial set. Through the use of Cloud computing technology and distributed databases, our system is capable of scaling with the rapidly growing genome repositories, and consequently of keeping the resulting data sets up-to-date. The system described is also more generically applicable to the discovery of specific targets for other diagnostic approaches such as DNA probes, PCR primers and antibodies.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-15-19},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells express a complex layer of noncoding RNAs. An intriguing family of regulatory RNAs includes transcripts from the opposite strand of protein coding genes, so called natural antisense transcripts (NATs). Here, we test the hypothesis that antisense transcription triggers RNA interference and gives rise to endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNAs).
RESULTS: We used cloned human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) followed by short RNAseq to investigate the small genic RNA transcriptome. 378 genes gave rise to short RNA reads that mapped to exons of RefSeq genes. The length profile of short RNAs showed a broad peak of 20-24 nucleotides, indicative of endo-siRNAs. Collapsed reads mapped predominantly to the first and the last exon of genes (74\%). RNAs reads were intersected with sequences occupied by RNAPII or bound to Argonaute (AGO1 by crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids, CLASH). In the first exon, 94\% of the reads correlated with RNAPII occupancy with an average density of 130 (relative units); this decreased to 65\%/20 in middle exons and 54\%/12 in the last exon. CLASH reads mapping to multi-exon genes showed little distribution bias with an average of about 5 CLASH reads overlapping with 60\% of the endo-siRNA reads. However, endo-siRNAs (21-25 nt) intersecting with CLASH reads were enriched at the 5'end and decreased towards the 3'end.We then investigated the 378 genes with particular focus on features indicative for short RNA production; however, found that endo-siRNA numbers did not correlate with gene structures that favor convergent transcription. In contrast, our gene set was found notably over-represented in the NATsDB sense/antisense group as compared to non-overlapping and non-bidirectional groups. Moreover, read counts showed no correlation with the steady-state levels of the related mRNAs and the pattern of endo-siRNAs proved reproducible after an induced mutagenic insult.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that antisense transcripts contribute to low levels of endo-siRNAs in fully differentiated human cells. A characteristic endo-siRNA footprint is being produced at sites of RNAPII transcription which is also related to AGO1. This endo-siRNA signature represents an intriguing finding and its reproducibility suggests that the production of endo-siRNAs is a regulated process with potential homoeostatic impact.},

To establish its utility in toxicity and genotoxicity screening, cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction, susceptibility to toxins, and transporter gene expression were examined. Conversion to B-13/H cells resulted in expression of male-specific CYP2C11 and sensitivity to methapyrilene. B-13/H cells constitutively expressed CYP1A, induced expression in response to an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, and activated benzo[α]pyrene to a DNA-damaging species. Functional CYP1A2 was not expressed due to deletions in the Cyp1a2 gene. A B-13 cell line stably expressing the human CYP1A2 was therefore engineered (B-13(-TR/h1A2)) and the derived B-13/H cells expressed metabolically functional CYP1A2. Treatment with the cooked food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage. B-13/H cells expressed constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and induced CYP2B1 mRNA levels in response to classical CAR activators. However, translation to functional CYP2B1 protein was low and increased minimally by CAR activator treatment. B-13/H cells expressed high levels of pregnane X-receptor (PXR) and induced CYP3A1 in response to classical PXR activators. CYP3A genes were inducible, functional, and activated aflatoxin B1 to a DNA-damaging species. All 23 major hepatic transporters were induced when B-13 cells were converted to B-13/H cells, although in many cases, levels remained below those present in adult rat liver. However, bile salt export pump, Abcb1b, multidrug resistance-associated protein, and breast cancer resistance protein transporters were functional in B-13/H cells. These data demonstrate that the B-13 cell generates hepatocyte-like cells with functional drug metabolism and transporter activities, which can alone--or in a humanized form--be used to screen for hepatotoxic and genotoxic endpoints in vitro.},

SQT tolerates peptide insertions at all three positions. Peptide aptamers in the SQT scaffold can be expressed in bacterial, yeast and human cells, and displayed as a fusion to truncated pIII on phage. Peptides that bind to CDK2 can show improved binding in protein microarrays when presented by the SQT scaffold. Yeast two-hybrid libraries have been screened for binders to the POZ domain of BCL-6 and to a peptide derived from PBP2', specific to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

	abstract = {Drug development is expensive and prone to failure. It is potentially much less risky and expensive to reuse a drug developed for one condition for treating a second disease, than it is to develop an entirely new compound. Systematic approaches to drug repositioning are needed to increase throughput and find candidates more reliably. Here we address this need with an integrated systems biology dataset, developed using the Ondex data integration platform, for the in silico discovery of new drug repositioning candidates. We demonstrate that the information in this dataset allows known repositioning examples to be discovered. We also propose a means of automating the search for new treatment indications of existing compounds.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Due to the limitations in experimental methods for determining binary interactions and structure determination of protein complexes, the need exists for computational models to fill the increasing gap between genome sequence information and protein annotation. Here we describe a novel method that uses structural models to reduce a large number of in silico predictions to a high confidence subset that is amenable to experimental validation.
RESULTS: A two-stage evaluation procedure was developed, first, a sequence-based method assessed the conservation of protein interface patches used in the original in silico prediction method, both in terms of position within the primary sequence, and in terms of sequence conservation. When applying the most stringent conditions it was found that 20.5\% of the data set being assessed passed this test. Secondly, a high-throughput structure-based docking evaluation procedure assessed the soundness of three dimensional models produced for the putative interactions. Of the data set being assessed, 8264 interactions or over 70\% could be modelled in this way, and 27\% of these can be considered 'valid' by the applied criteria. In all, 6.9\% of the interactions passed both the tests and can be considered to be a high confidence set of predicted interactions, several of which are described.
